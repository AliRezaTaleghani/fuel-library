Download Fuel
-------------

The first step in installing Fuel is to download the version
appropriate to your environment.

Fuel is available for both Essex and Folsom OpenStack installations, and will be available for Grizzly
shortly after Grizzly's release.

To make your installation easier, we also offer a pre-built ISO for installing master node with Puppet Master and Cobbler. You can mount this ISO in a physical or VirtualBox machine in order to
easily create your master node. (Instructions for performing this step
without the ISO are given in Appendix A.)

Master node ISO, as well as Fuel releases, are available at "Downloads" section at the Fuel portal: http://fuel.mirantis.com/your-downloads/
