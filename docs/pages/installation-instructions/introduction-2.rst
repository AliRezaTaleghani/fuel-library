Installation Instructions
=========================

Introduction
------------

You can follow these instructions in order to get a production-grade OpenStack installation on hardware, or you can just do a dry run using VirtualBox to get a feel of how Fuel works.

If you decide to give Fuel a try using VirtualBox, you will need the latest stable VirtualBox (version 4.2.4 at the moment), as well as a stable host system, preferably Mac OS 10.7.x, CentOS 6.3, or Ubuntu 12.04. Windows 8 also works, but is not recommended. VirtualBox has to be installed with "extension pack", which enables PXE boot capabilities on Intel network adapters.

The list of certified hardware configuration is coming up in one of the next versions of Fuel.

If you run into any issues during the installation, please check :ref:`common-technical-issues` for common problems and resolutions.
